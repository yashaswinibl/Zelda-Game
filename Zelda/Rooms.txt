A cool shudder trickles down your spine. Glancing around nervously, you see somber portraits staring at you from behind layers of dust, seemingly penetrating your very being. The Exit to Castle is to your West.
Cold, hesitant light streams in through a cracked window, casting eerie shadows on the walls.
This room has weird shapes drawn all over the walls and flickering torches make the faces even scarier.
Wind wailing and howling curtains shivering with the cold breeze and the floorboards creaked uneasily like a nervous wreck.
Squeaky doors, floorboards that creak, dust bunnies and cobwebs, shadows and eerie noises, all waiting for you in this room.
Windows covered with grime and dirt, the calm moonlight struggled to penetrate the darkness in thin thread rays. Sharp shadows roamed around the room.
The fire is dead. The room is cold ,awake and head throbbing.The vision is blurry.
Darkness. It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
The darkness is heavy, the walls feel thick and close.
